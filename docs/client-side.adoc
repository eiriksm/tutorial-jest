== Source code

Let's write a test for the following functional React component:

.src/main/resources/assets/js/HelloWorld.tsx
[source, typescript]
----
include::{sourcedir}src/main/resources/assets/js/HelloWorld.tsx[]
----

== Test

== Summary

In this guide, we have learned how to write a test for a React component using Jest and React Test Renderer.

Now that there exists some tests, it may be useful to store coverage reports in a tool that can show progress over time. One such tool is Codecov. The following tutorial will show you how to integrate link:coverage[Codecov] with your project.
